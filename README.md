# Analog-Data-Logger-With-Interrupt-Driven-Alarm
## Description
Monitor and display temperature from three rooms using ADC peripheral and using the concept of chaining between 3 channels.
Display the temperature readings on a 4x20 LCD.
Trigger an external interrupt if the temperature exceeds 40Â°C.
the interrupt ISR is an alarm on LCD and a red lamp is turned on.
## Hardware
- AVR ATmega32
